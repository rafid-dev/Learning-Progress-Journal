Thanks to my friend Finny, whose inspiration sparked my deepening passion for mathematics and physics. Without his influence, I might never have developed such a strong love for these fields.

Things Finny taught me:

- Euler's Identity
- Derivatives
- Optimization
- Approximating Derivatives Using Central Difference
- Taylor Series
- Proving the Pythagorean Theorem in 3D
- Ordinary Differential Equations:
    - Solving by Separation of Variables
    - Solving Numerically Using Forward Euler Method
    - Simulating Pendulum Swinging
    - Simulating N body orbitting each other using Newton's Law Of Gravitation
- Double Integration:
    - Finding Area of Circle Using Double Integral
- Conservation of Momentum and Kinetic Energy
- Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
